Having a separator string appended to the end of the prompt makes it clearer to the fine-tuned model where the completion should begin. See https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset for more detail and examples. If you intend to do open-ended generation, then you should leave the prompts empty\n",
